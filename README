This program allows you to detect a face on a picture.

* To compile it you have to use
make

* To execute it you have to use
./main

* To remove all the compiled files you have to use
make clean

Once executed, the program loads an interface. It will help you load images
and add them to the database. Once added, the program will ask you the name
of the person and will display the image. You then have to press any key to
launch the analysis of the image. After a short period of time, the picture
will refresh with the 3 most probable positions of a face in the picture.

Thank you for using our program.
